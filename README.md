# TheEditor-19

## Description
Hello, I am presenting my PWA (Progressive Web Applications) that is referred to as a Text Editor. My goal within this project is to is to use the IndexDB database to store data into it and also while retrieving data as well. The application will present a way to create notes or even code snippets while using internet or not. This a great way to save information using the database whenever you could run into a minor internet issue in the future.


## Installation

Reproduce my repository on my Github. The link is below, followed by my deployed version.

[TheEditor repository](https://github.com/Jwarren619/TheEditor-19).


1 - When I open my application in my editor, then I should see a client server folder structure.

2 - When I run `npm run start` from the root directory and find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.

3 - When I run the text editor application from my terminal and then I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.

4 - When I run my webpack plugins, then I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.

5 - When the user uses next-gen JavaScript in the application, the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.

6 - When the user opens the text editor, the user will find the IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.

7 - When the user enters content and subsequently clicks off of the DOM window, the content in the text editor is saved with IndexedDB.

8 - When the user reopens the text editor after closing it, the content in the text editor has been retrieved from the IndexedDB.

9 - When the user clicks on the Install button, the application is downloaded as an icon on the user's desktop.

10 - When the user loads the application, the user can register a service worker using workbox.

11 - When the user registers a service worker, the user's static assets are pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.

12 - When the user deploys to Heroku, the user has a proper build scripts for a webpack application.

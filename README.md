# TheEditor-19

## Description
Hello, I am presenting my PWA (Progressive Web Applications) that is referred to as a Text Editor. My goal within this project is to is to use the IndexDB darabase to store data into it and also while retrieving data as well. The application will present a way to create notes or even code snippets while using internet or not. This a great way to save information using the database whenever you could run into a minor internet issue in the future.

## Visual
